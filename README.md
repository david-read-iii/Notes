# Notes App
A simple notes app built in Android. It presents notes as a list view to the user. To add a new note, just press the add button in the action bar. To modify an existing note, just tap the note from the list view. Either of these button presses presents the user with a form to specify attributes for the note.

The app stores notes as an array list of note objects. Between app executions, it saves the current state of the array list to persistent storage using shared preferences.

This app was prepared for a workshop presented to the Montclair State University Computer Club.
